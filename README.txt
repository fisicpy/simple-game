To run this code you must install all packages you need to do this use this command:
	pip install -r requirements.txt
Then you must run code by this command:
	python main.py

In apple.py, player.py and level.py are classes which is for apple, player and level. In file config.py is some setting for this project, but I advise you don't change this settings because the code may not run. In main.py there is main code of project. We use module keyboard because pygame.key doesn't allow us to hold buttons on keyboard.
